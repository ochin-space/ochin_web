The "Service editor" is web a tool that allows you to modify and create new services to be started at system boot by means of the systemd service manager.<br>
All the services created are displayed in a table that allows you to edit or delete them. <br>
<h5>Create a new Service</h5>By pressing the "Add New Service +" icon on the top right edge of the table, you create a new empty row in the table. Once the new row is created you can edit
in order to start your new service. <br><br>
<h5>Edit a Service</h5>By pressing the "edit" button corresponding to the service of interest, a popup will be opened, from which it is possible to modify the parameters of the service itself. <br>
In the upper part of the modal window there is a selection box, from which it is possible to select a service among those present by default. To add or remove services from the default list, you need to edit the file "/var/www/html/ochin/apps/service_editor/helper/defaultServices.json". <br>
The "Cmd Line:" field contains the script to execute. <br>
The "[Unit] options:" field contains the options related to the unit. <br>
The "[Service] options:" field contains the options related to the service. <br>
The "[Install] options:" field contains the options relating to the installation phase of the unit (enable or disable).

The "Description:" field contains a description of the service, useful for noting the characteristics and functionalities of the service. <br><br>
<h5>Delete a Service</h5>By pressing the "delete" button corresponding to the service of interest, you can delete the service. <br><br>
<h5>Manual tool</h5>By pressing the "Manual" button corresponding to the service of interest a popup will be opened. On the "Manual" modal window it is possible to start, stop or check the status of the service and see the results in a terminal console.
<br><br>
<h5>What this tool actually does</h5>
To create a new service you need to create a new file /lib/systemd/system/filename.service adding the following minimal text. If the "Type" field within the [Service] 
field is set to "idle", means that the service will be started after everything else. The "ExecStart" field indicate the script to execute with absolute path.
<br><br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
[Unit]<br>
Description= new filename service description<br>
After=multi-user.target<br>
<br>
[Service]<br>
Type=idle<br>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/ochin/workspace/python/filename.py<br>
<br>
[Install]<br>
WantedBy=multi-user.target<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Once the service has been created, it's possible to configure it using the systemctl tool.
<br><br>
sudo systemctl daemon-reload<br>
sudo systemctl enable filename.service

<h4>systemd</h4>
<p><i>from <a href="https://systemd.io/" target="_blank">system.io</a>  website</i><br>
Systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, 
keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based 
service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit.
<br>
<br>
<p><i>from <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html#" target="_blank">www.freedesktop.org</a>  website</i><br>
systemd provides a dependency system between various entities called "units" of 11 different types. Units encapsulate various objects that are relevant 
for system boot-up and maintenance. The majority of units are configured in unit configuration files, whose syntax and basic set of options is described 
in systemd.unit(5), however some are created automatically from other configuration, dynamically from system state or programmatically at runtime. 
Units may be "active" (meaning started, bound, plugged in, …, depending on the unit type, see below), or "inactive" (meaning stopped, unbound, unplugged, …), 
as well as in the process of being activated or deactivated, i.e. between the two states (these states are called "activating", "deactivating"). 
A special "failed" state is available as well, which is very similar to "inactive" and is entered when the service failed in some way (process returned 
error code on exit, or crashed, an operation timed out, or after too many restarts). If this state is entered, the cause will be logged, for later reference.
<br>
On boot systemd activates the target unit default.target whose job is to activate on-boot services and other on-boot units by pulling them in via dependencies.
