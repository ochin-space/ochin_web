"Runnable": It means that the configuration could be running or not, depends if it's enabled. If it's not "Runnable" it means that the adapter is configured in a different mode (ex. config is sta_mode but adapter is actually ap_mode)<br>
"Adapter Name": Is the name of the hardware network adapter<br>
"AP Mode": If enabled, the config contemplate the "Access Point" Mode. If false, the config contemplate the "Station Mode" and will connect to an external Access Point<br>
"Static IP Mode": If enabled, the config contemplate a static IP address<br>
"SSID": Is the SSID of the network<br>
"Subnet Mask": Is the Subnet Mask of the network created in Access Point Mode<br>
"sDHCP start/stop": Is the range of the IP Addresses handled by the DHCP server<br><br>
<h5> Edit the configuration </h5> By pressing the "edit" button corresponding to the row of interest, a popup will be opened, from which it is possible to modify the network configuration. <br>
On the top of the modal windows there is a selection box with a list of the available adapters. <br>

The second switch is used to configure the adapter in access point mode or station mode. <br>
To configure the adapter to connect to a certain WLAN, you just have to fill the two fieds below: SSID and Password. <br>
Selecting the next switch is possible to set a static IP_Address and SubnetMask instead of using the DHCP. <br> <br>
In case you want to create an Access Point, the proper switch should be selected and new fields will be shown. <br>
The SSID and Password  are still there, but in AP mode those represent the brand new WLAN that it's going to be created. <br>
The Country Code must be filled and depends on the Country where you want to create the WLAN. <br>
The IP_Address and NetMask are related to the board, wich works as a gateway. <br>
The DHCP is enabled by default and the DHCP_start and DHCP_end represent the range of IPs that will be assigned to the connected clients. <br>
Once the "Confirm" button is pressed, the configuration will be written to the system. In order to have the new cofnig fully working a system reboot is needed.
