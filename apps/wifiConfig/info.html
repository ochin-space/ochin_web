In case you want to create an Access Point, the first switch should be selected and new fields will be shown. <br>
The SSID and Password  are still there, but in AP mode those represent the brand new WLAN that it's going to be created. <br>
The Country Code must be filled and depends on the Country where you want to create the WLAN. <br>
