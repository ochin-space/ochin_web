The "Hardware Configuration" is web a tool that allows you to modify the "boot/config.txt" file.<br>
<p><i>from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/config_txt.html" target="_blank">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/config_txt.html</a>  website</i><br>
<h5>What is config.txt?</h5>
The Raspberry Pi uses a configuration file instead of the BIOS you would expect to find on a conventional PC. The system configuration parameters, 
which would traditionally be edited and stored using a BIOS, are stored instead in an optional text file named config.txt. 
This is read by the GPU before the ARM CPU and Linux are initialised. It must therefore be located on the first (boot) partition of your SD card, 
alongside bootcode.bin and start.elf. This file is normally accessible as /boot/config.txt from Linux, and must be edited as root.<br><br>

<h5>File Format</h5>
The config.txt file is read by the early-stage boot firmware, so it has a very simple file format. The format is a single property=value 
statement on each line, where value is either an integer or a string. Comments may be added, or existing config values may be commented 
out and disabled, by starting a line with the # character.<br>
There is an 80 character line length limit to entries, any characters past this limit will be ignored.<br><br>

<h5>gpu_mem</h5>
Specifies how much memory, in megabytes, to reserve for the exclusive use of the GPU: the remaining memory is allocated to the ARM CPU for use by the OS.
For Pis with less than 1GB of memory, the default is 64; for Pis with 1GB or more of memory the default is 76.<br>
The memory allocated to the GPU is used for display, 3D, Codec and camera purposes as well as some basic firmware housekeeping. The maximums specified below 
assume you are using all these features. If you are not, then smaller values of gpu_mem can be used.<br>
To ensure the best performance of Linux, you should set gpu_mem to the lowest possible value. If a particular graphics feature is not working correctly, try 
increasing the value of gpu_mem, being mindful of the recommended maximums shown below.
<br><font color="red">Important:<br> Unlike GPU’s found on x86 machines, where increasing memory can improve 3D performance, the architecture of the VideoCore means there is no performance
advantage from specifying values larger than is necessary, and in fact it can harm performance.</font><br>
On the Raspberry Pi 4 the 3D component of the GPU has its own memory management unit (MMU), and does not use memory from the gpu_mem allocation. Instead memory 
is allocated dynamically within Linux.<br><br>

<h5>total_mem</h5>
This parameter can be used to force a Raspberry Pi to limit its memory capacity: specify the total amount of RAM, in megabytes, you wish the Raspberry Pi to use.
<br>For example, to make a 4GB Raspberry Pi 4B behave as though it were a 1GB model, use the following:<br>
total_mem=1024<br><br>

<h5>disable_l2cache</h5>
Setting this to 1 disables the CPU’s access to the GPU’s L2 cache and requires a corresponding L2 disabled kernel. Default value on BCM2835 is 0. On BCM2836, BCM2837, 
and BCM2711, the ARMs have their own L2 cache and therefore the default is 1. The standard Pi kernel.img and kernel7.img builds reflect this difference in cache setting.<br><br>

<h5>Composite Video Mode</h5>
sdtv_mode<br>
The sdtv_mode command defines the TV standard used for composite video output. On the original Raspberry Pi, composite video is output on the RCA socket. 
On other Raspberry Pi’s, except for Pi Zero and Compute Module, composite video is output along with sound on the 4 pole TRRS ("headphone") socket. 
On the Pi Zero, there is an unpopulated header labelled "TV" which outputs composite video. On the Compute Module, composite video is available via the TVDAC pin. 
The default value of sdtv_mode is 0.<br><br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
sdtv_mode -> result<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
0  -> Normal NTSC<br>
1  -> Japanese version of NTSC — no pedestal<br>
2  -> Normal PAL<br>
3  -> Brazilian version of PAL — 525/60 rather than 625/50, different subcarrier<br>
16 -> Progressive scan NTSC<br>
18 -> Progressive scan PAL<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>
<h5>sdtv_aspect</h5>
The sdtv_aspect command defines the aspect ratio for composite video output. The default value is 1.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
sdtv_aspect -> result<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
1 -> 4:3<br>
2 -> 14:9<br>
3 -> 16:9<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>

<h5>sdtv_disable_colourburst</h5>
Setting sdtv_disable_colourburst to 1 disables colourburst on composite video output. The picture will be displayed in monochrome, but it may appear sharper.<br><br>

<h5>enable_tvout</h5>
On the Raspberry Pi 4, composite output is disabled by default, due to the way the internal clocks are interrelated and allocated. Because composite video 
requires a very specific clock, setting that clock to the required speed on the Pi 4 means that other clocks connected to it are detrimentally affected, 
which slightly slows down the entire system. Since composite video is a less commonly used function, we decided to disable it by default to prevent this system slowdown.<br>
To enable composite output, use the enable_tvout=1 option. As described above, this will detrimentally affect performance to a small degree.<br>
On older Pi models, the composite behaviour remains the same.<br><br>

<h5>disable_overscan</h5>

Set disable_overscan to 1 to disable the default values of overscan that is set by the firmware. The default value of overscan for the left, right, top, and bottom edges 
is 48 for HD CEA modes, 32 for SD CEA modes, and 0 for DMT modes. The default value for disable_overscan is 0.<br>
Note<br>
	Any further additional overscan options such as overscan_scale or overscan edges can still be applied after this option.<br><br>

<h5>overscan_left</h5>
The overscan_left command specifies the number of pixels to add to the firmware default value of overscan on the left edge of the screen. The default value is 0.<br>
Increase this value if the text flows off the left edge of the screen; decrease it if there is a black border between the left edge of the screen and the text.<br><br>

<h5>overscan_right</h5>
The overscan_right command specifies the number of pixels to add to the firmware default value of overscan on the right edge of the screen. The default value is 0.<br>
Increase this value if the text flows off the right edge of the screen; decrease it if there is a black border between the right edge of the screen and the text.<br><br>

<h5>overscan_top</h5>
The overscan_top command specifies the number of pixels to add to the firmware default value of overscan on the top edge of the screen. The default value is 0.<br>
Increase this value if the text flows off the top edge of the screen; decrease it if there is a black border between the top edge of the screen and the text.<br><br>

<h5>overscan_bottom</h5>
The overscan_bottom command specifies the number of pixels to add to the firmware default value of overscan on the bottom edge of the screen. The default value is 0.<br>
Increase this value if the text flows off the bottom edge of the screen; decrease it if there is a black border between the bottom edge of the screen and the text.<br><br>

<h5>overscan_scale</h5>
Set overscan_scale to 1 to force any non-framebuffer layers to conform to the overscan settings. The default value is 0.<br>
NOTE: this feature is generally not recommended: it can reduce image quality because all layers on the display will be scaled by the GPU. Disabling overscan on the display 
itself is the recommended option to avoid images being scaled twice (by the GPU and the display).<br><br>

<h5>framebuffer_width</h5>
The framebuffer_width command specifies the console framebuffer width in pixels. The default is the display width minus the total horizontal overscan.<br><br>

<h5>framebuffer_height</h5>
The framebuffer_height command specifies the console framebuffer height in pixels. The default is the display height minus the total vertical overscan.<br>
max_framebuffer_heigh`t, `max_framebuffer_width<br>
Specifies the maximum dimensions that the internal frame buffer is allowed to be.<br><br>

<h5>framebuffer_depth</h5>
Use framebuffer_depth to specify the console framebuffer depth in bits per pixel. The default value is 16.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
framebuffer_depth -> result 	notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
8 -> 8bit framebuffer Default RGB palette makes screen unreadable<br>
16 -> 16bit framebuffer<br>
24 -> 24bit framebuffer. May result in a corrupted display<br>
32 -> 32bit framebuffer. May need to be used in conjunction with framebuffer_ignore_alpha=1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>

<h5>framebuffer_ignore_alpha</h5>
Set framebuffer_ignore_alpha to 1 to disable the alpha channel. Can help with the display of a 32bit framebuffer_depth.
