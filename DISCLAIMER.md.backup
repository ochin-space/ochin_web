# IMPORTANT NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER
-    This software is based on the use of an Apache webserver and is in fact a website. Unlike a normal public website, it must be able to perform operations on the Operating System files with advanced administrator rights. For this to happen, the software uses a background service that exchanges information with the webserver and manages the system files (limited only to the necessary files). In this way the user "www-data", who manages the webserver, does not have direct access to the system. However, this implies an implicit reduction in the security level of the system. The software itself allows the user to perform advanced operations that can compromise the stability of the system. With the aim of increasing security, potentially dangerous operations are limited to local access (from IPs present in the same subnet of the webserver). That said, it is highly inadvisable to make the web interface public, due to the risks involved in having a public website managed by a user who is also an operating system administrator. For these reasons, before using this software it is necessary to understand well what are the objectives for which it was created and its limits.

- The software is meant to become a web development platform for Raspberry Pi board-based devices. The basic structure of the software allows you to manage services, the hardware configuration of the Raspberry pi board, kernel modules, networking boards and more. Addons can be installed on the base structure to provide advanced features. The software is therefore suitable for projects where the Raspberry Pi board is used to manage a hardware device, such as a robot. In this case the sw ochin_web is used as a graphical interface to manage the machine, accessible only to the developer or user of the robot. It is highly inadvisable to make the web interface public, due to the risks involved in having a public website managed by a user who is also an operating system administrator.
